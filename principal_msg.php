                            <p class="section-text">It is a great privilege and honor to connect with you through this platform!
                                Auxilium College stands as a beacon of hope, excellence, and inspiration, run by the Salesian Sisters
                                of Don Bosco, an organization with educational and service institutions in over 90 countries worldwide.
                                Guided by the charism of our founders—“Give me souls, take away the rest”—we dedicate ourselves to
                                uplifting and nurturing young minds, especially the least and the lost, by offering them the best
                                opportunities for growth and development.
                            </p>
                            <p class="section-text">However, the greatness of an institution is not measured by its buildings or facilities but by its
                                students. *Yes, dear students*, you are the heart and soul of Auxilium College. We encourage you to
                                strive for excellence and to let the sky be your limit. As Pope Francis reminds us, “To educate is
                                an act of hope.” Our mission is to bring this hope alive in your hearts and minds.
                            </p>

                            for a lifetime, educate people.” *Dear lecturers*, you have been entrusted with this noble challenge of
                            education—a task that leaves a lifelong impact on these brilliant young minds. Let us embrace this God-given
