                                                Auxilium Arts and Science College for Women is located in Chittampatti, a fertile agrarian area on the
                                                outskirts of Madurai District, well-connected to over 100 surrounding villages. The mission began in
                                                2015 under the visionary leadership of Rev. Sr. Magnificat Soosai, FMA, then Provincial of the undivided
                                                Chennai Province (INM). She envisioned a higher education center strategically positioned to benefit the
                                                local community. The college's journey began with an initial land acquisition of 3.5 acres, which was
                                                later expanded to 6.39 acres following the bifurcation of the province in 2017, leading to the establishment
                                                of the Province of Tiruchirappalli (INT).

                                                Rev. Sr. Amalanathan Mary Margaret, the first Provincial of Our Lady of Snow Province, Tiruchirappalli,
                                                continued this vision. Recognizing the need for an Arts and Science College for Women, she and her council
                                                spearheaded the college's establishment. Construction began, and the first phase was completed and blessed
                                                on "February 13, 2022", during the Province Gratitude Day.
